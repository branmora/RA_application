# RA Sample Code

This is a repository contains sample code for my research projects written in Stata, Python and R:

- `sample_code.do`: Contains code that estimates the long-term effects of having access to a health facility during the first years of life. We employ a difference-in-differences strategy with data from SUSALUD establishments and the Demographic and Family Health Survey.
- `sample_code.py`: Contains code that performs matching between schools based on geographical distance. We match the nearest school with data from the National Standarized Test dataset to the nearest school that did not participate during the 2019 run.
- `sample_code.R`: Contains code that uses data from the National Census of Police Stations, international oil prices and local gasoline prices to study the effect of fuel prices on road safety in the Cusco Region using a two-way fixed effects regression.
